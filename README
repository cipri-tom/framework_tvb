TVB FRAMEWORK
==============

The Virtual Brain framework is a complete framework including:
- a plugable workflow manager;
- a data persistence layer (with a relational DB and File Storage);
- a browser-based user interface;
- visualizers for neuro-science related entities.


In order to use this Framework, you are advised to follow the steps described here: 
https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/docs/blob/trunk/README.md

You could also independently install Python and all other referenced libraries, but we do not offer support for this option.
For this unrecommended use-case: TVB Scientific Library (available in a peer repository on GitHub), needs to be in the path of Python.

For more details check http://www.thevirtualbrain.org/.

Enjoy TVB!
