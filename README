TVB FRAMEWORK
==============

The Virtual Brain framework is a complete framework including:
- a plugable workflow manager;
- a data persistence layer (with a relational DB and File Storage);
- a browser-based user interface;
- visualizers for neuro-science related entities.


In order to use this Framework, you should independently install Python and all other referenced libraries. 
Also TVB Scientific Library (available in a peer repository on GitHub), needs to be in the path of Python.

To start right away (without the need to install any addition packages), get our free distribution package:
